I’ve been really into science and technology as a kids, but never had the opportunity or interest to look into (popular) economics at all, which I definitely thought was a missed opportunity after reading Freakonomics*.* While I have absolutely no idea how close the book is to real economics, most of it involves presenting compelling theories for the way certain markets work when looking through history. For instance, the drug wave of the 90s and subsequent decline in crime are attributed to the history of abortion law in the US around 20 years prior. All of Dubner’s theories are well explained to the point of which even a layman would understand. At certain times, however, he does go into excessive depth; I think that a scientific mind needs to, although it definitely did turn off the causal reader in me.

Freakonomics isn’t a technical book by any means, but just a way to get a quick appreciation of the study of economics, which I definitely think it has for me. It’s likely not something that I’ll read again, but definitely something that I’ll continue to think about and bring up in conversations.
