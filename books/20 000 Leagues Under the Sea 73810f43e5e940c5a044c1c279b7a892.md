To be fair, this wasn’t my first time reading this. I read it back in 5th grade out of being jealous that Sid Mani read it, which is probably a testament to how weird of a person I was back then. To be fair, I think it’s possible that I may have enjoyed it more back then than I did now. I read and finished the book on the plane, but I’m pretty sure that my mental capacities were pretty lowered - I basically just read it like a tabloid magazine, with eyes glossed over.

Regardless, the story is still amazing. It manages to captures the excitement and feverish delight of exploring a place on Earth that no one’s ever been before; the types of sights and descriptions that Verne provides are simply awesome. To be fair, there are times when he goes overboard with the scientific descriptions on this one. I think most people reading this don’t really care what scientific class the mollusks under the sea are. Although it lends to the “scientific expedition” vibe that he was going for, it’s just a little extra, my dude.

I think this is one of those books that I’ll continue to read throughout my lifetime not necessarily because I expect to discover new meaning, but just to relive that excitement of exploring and adventuring.
