Ahh, the classic book. My first time reading JCE was when I was in the 3rd grade--I’m still not sure how I understood the novel, but it definitely awoke a strong appreciation of science fiction in me, which is something that continues today. Reading the book around 10 years later, I think I went through many of the same emotions while reading the novel. My mind soared at the underground vaults and wondered if such a large mystery could be possible, even if years of schooling has told me that it isn’t. It’s true that the characters themselves have little to no depth; the professor is a heated and passionate scientist, while Hans is a simple yet loyal worker. And although I love looking at character development, I think the best way to judge a book is by what it puts forth best. I don’t have much to say or analyze about JCE other than it woke a childlike excitement in me, which is something I haven’t seen in a while. Wonderful.
