Here's a list of interesting things that I've either stumbled upon or read that I'd like to keep around:

## Lifestyle

- Polyphasic sleep schedules are when people sleep at multiple points in a day and somehow end up feeling more energized than a regular sleep schedule.
    - There's an interesting [wiki](https://polysleep.org/wiki/Main_Page) that has quite a bit of information, as well as a [VICE article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/vv7e8m/the-uberwomen-who-beat-sleep) giving a deep dive into the individual that started it. 
    - A number of people on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3807572) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/cp4jrn/polyphasic_sleep/) seem to have had fairly negative experiences trying this out.
    - This seems pretty fun to try. I think I'd like to do the [E1](https://polysleep.org/wiki/E1) if I end up doing this, but I also wonder what I'd do with all my free time. I've naturally developed a [Siesta](https://polysleep.org/wiki/Siesta)-type schedule already, so I wonder if it would be easy to convert.
- [Pavlok](https://pavlok.com/) is a device you wear on your wrist that lets you send little electrical shocks to yourself. The idea is that this would provide a negative feedback loop to cut down on bad habits subconsciously.
    - This is something I've wanted to play around with for 5+ years, but the high cost is definitely a bit off-putting. However, this is a good case-study in value-based pricing. It likely costs very little manufacture, but the value for the end user is fairly high.
    - I've heard a rubber band is a low-cost alternative to this - but hey, shocking yourself definitely does have a morbid appeal.
- [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) is a keyboard layout meant to increase efficiency when typing. By placing commonly used characters on the home row of the keyboard, this layout minimizes key travel distance.
    - I wonder if this is worth the switch for me, since my type speed is around 120wpm on QWERTY. However, my error rate is fairly high and I reducing hand strain seems to be a good goal for the future. I also saw a fun post from someone about how they hit 200wpm on Colemak after switching from QWERTY 110wpm, which seems very exciting if I do that. 
    - Interestingly, this doesn't quite work for mobile keyboards. QWERTY was developed to alterate hands between keys in commonly used digrams, which ends up being pretty useful for a mobile keyboard.
- I'd also like to try using an [ortholinear](https://www.reviewgeek.com/70291/what-is-an-ortholinear-keyboard-and-should-you-use-one/) keyboard to reduce hand strain as well.
    - Regular keyboards are staggered, a vestige of the typewriter days where they typerwriter levers couldn't intersect with each other and had to be offset. 
    - Instead, ortholinear keyboards follow a grid based layout. It's unclear to me what the difference really is (it looks nicer!) but it seems fun to try out.
- [Lucid dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) are dreams where the dreamers knows that they are dreaming. 
    - I've tried experimenting with this when I was younger, but didn't consistently keep up with it.
    - It seems possible useful to be able to access the creativity of your dream state but with the focus of your conscious self. 
    - Keeping a dream journal apparently works, as do affirmations, but I've yet to try either.


## Computer Science
- How does [Git](https://git-scm.com/) work? I think I know the basics (i.e. copy on write), but I don't know the specific details. 
    - I also have very little understanding of the common Git commands other than the 5-6 I use commonly. Recloning a repository whenever things go awry is not the move!
- Using [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) seems like a fun thing to try. I'm specifically more interested in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) along with tmux (also something I know very little about). Having a customized command line would be neat - I'm very basic now.
