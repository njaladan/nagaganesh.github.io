Here's a list of interesting things that I've either stumbled upon or read that I'd like to keep around:

## Things to try

- Polyphasic sleep schedules are when people sleep at multiple points in a day and somehow end up feeling more energized than a regular sleep schedule.
    - There's an interesting [wiki](https://polysleep.org/wiki/Main_Page) that has quite a bit of information, as well as a [VICE article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/vv7e8m/the-uberwomen-who-beat-sleep) giving a deep dive into the individual that started it.

    - I've heard a rubber band is a low-cost alternative to this - but hey, shocking yourself definitely does have a morbid appeal.
- [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) is a keyboard layout meant to increase efficiency when typing. By placing commonly used characters on the home row of the keyboard, this layout minimize
