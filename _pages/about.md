I'm an student at UC Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My primary interests are distributed systems, computational complexity, and finance.

This summer, I'm interning at [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) on the Reporting Products team. In the past, I've worked at [D. E. Shaw](https://www.deshaw.com/) as a quant developer intern and at [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) as an ML Applications intern.

I'm passionate about teaching. Previously, I've helped teach [Computer Security](https://cs161.org/) and [Discrete Mathematics](http://eecs70.org/) as a TA at Berkeley.

In my free time, I enjoy [reading]( {{ site.baseurl }}/reading ), watching plays, [distance running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14026876), drinking tea, and [programming](https://github.com/njaladan).

My full name is Nagaganesh Jaladanki. <a href="javascript:alert('it');">This</a> is how you pronounce it.

If you'd like to say hi, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:nagaganesh@berkeley.edu).
